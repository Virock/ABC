            <p>As fellow travelers on the road to financial empowerment, we intimately understand how dealing with finances can prompt severe anxiety… or tremendous boredom. We can also relate to the joy of finally understanding something important about our personal finances and the financial world within which we operate. Not just joy, but also a desire to share this knowledge with others</p>
            <p class="mt-2 mb-3">With the majority of Americans unable to come up with $400 in the event of an emergency and communities of color on the road to a median of zero wealth if we do nothing, there is a strong undercurrent of economic stress that threatens our democracy. How are people supposed to set aside money to get ahead? We believe larger systemic changes can help, such as directing the federal budget for asset building to invest in the majority of Americans, rather than its highest earners. We also believe that there is plenty for us to do while we wait for the larger changes.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We can take free financial courses or attend public talks</li>
              <li>We can learn about, and take part in, local programs that help people save money and improve their credit</li>
              <li>We can help someone check their credit report or let them know where to get their taxes filed</li>
              <li>We can invite someone to join us, and encourage them to come up with other ways to build financial empowerment</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>ABC pays people to perform financially empowering acts. We give points for every financially empowered act you document completing, whether for yourself or others. Both giving and receiving are equally important -- you can’t share what you never learned. Paying ourselves is also important. Even the smallest rewards can shape habits. Since you don’t have to spend your points until you want to, you can be sure that whatever reward you choose will be one you love.</p>
